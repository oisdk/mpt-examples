## Problem 1: Graph problem from last week [(2011 question 3)](http://aipo.computing.dcu.ie/2011-programming-problems)

[This website](http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html) has the best tutorial.

If you have time, implement A* for the general case.

## Problem 2: Levenshtein distance

Input: Two words, separated by a space

Output: The edit distance between te two words, according to the [wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenstein_Distance)

## Problem 3: Write a tabulated version of the Fibonacci function.

For those interested:

Write a similar function for [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle).

Both of these recursive functions are [recurrence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation). That means (kind of) that they form sequences where each element relies on previous elements. You might notice the parallel here between recurrence relations and functions which can be tabulated. Can you write a function which will tabulate *any* recurrence relation?

## Problem 4:

Self-ref nums

## Problem 5:

Arrange nums
